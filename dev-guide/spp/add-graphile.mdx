## Add the API
- Add new GraphQL query inside a new file in folder `SansPaper-Pilot/src/graphql/queries`.
- Open the file `SansPaper-Pilot/codegen.ts`. Update new Bearer token in Authorization config section.

<Note>
  To get the Bearer token, inspect an API call on browser, and check on the 'Authorization' section in Request Headers.
</Note>

- Open a terminal. Navigate to the `SansPaper-Pilot` folder.
- Run this command.

```sh
npx graphql-code-generator --config codegen.ts
```

- Make sure the command finished successfully without any error.
- New API is added. Check the details at the bottom of file `SansPaper-Pilot/src/gql/_generated.ts`.
- If the file `_generated.ts` has error, comment below line of code inside the file.

```ts
import { RequestInit } from 'graphql-request/dist/types.dom'; //comment this line
```

- Open the backend portal [Staging API](https://form-staging2.sanspaper.com/api/login).
