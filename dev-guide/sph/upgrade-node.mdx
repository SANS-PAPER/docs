## <Icon icon="list-check"  size={30}/> Prerequisite
- Node v20 or latest _(20.18.3)_

## <Icon icon="folder-closed"  size={30}/> Backup Your Project
- Before starting, make sure to backup your project, including your node_modules and package-lock.json (if applicable), just in case you need to revert any changes.

## <Icon icon="circle-check"  size={30}/> Check Node.js Compatibility
- Review Dependencies: Check the compatibility of your project dependencies with Node.js v20. Some older packages may not be compatible with v20, and you may need to upgrade or replace them.
- Visit the Node.js official changelog to review breaking changes and deprecations between versions.

## <Icon icon="circle-play"  size={30}/> Getting Started
- Install node v20 or above from node official site [Node Official Site](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
- If you are using nvm (Node Version Manager), you can switch Node.js versions easily.
- Install nvm (if not already installed):

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```

- Install Node.js v20:

```sh
nvm install 20
```

- Use Node.js v20:

```sh
nvm use 20
```

## <Icon icon="trash-can" size={30}/> Clear Existing node_modules
- After upgrading Node.js, remove the node_modules directory and reinstall your project dependencies. 
- This ensures that all packages are compiled for the correct Node.js version.

<Note>
  This step should be applied for every folder that contains package.json. In this project, you should apply it to root, client and server folder.
</Note>

```sh
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json  # If you're using npm, or yarn.lock for Yarn
npm install           # Or yarn install if you're using Yarn
```

## <Icon icon="gears"  size={30}/> Update Project Dependencies
- Update Dependencies: You need to update your project's dependencies to their latest versions compatible with Node.js v20.

```sh
npm outdated  # To see outdated packages
npm update    # To update minor/patch versions
```

- If some packages require major updates, you'll need to check their changelogs for breaking changes and migrate accordingly.
- Check for Deprecated Packages: Some packages might be deprecated or have better alternatives. Check for such packages and update them.

## <Icon icon="gears"  size={30}/> Test Your Application
- After upgrading Node.js and updating your dependencies:
  1. Run Tests: If you have automated tests, run them to ensure everything works as expected.

```sh 
npm test
```

  2. Manual Testing: Manually test the key functionalities of your application (especially Express routes and middleware) to check for any issues.

## <Icon icon="react"  size={30}/> Address Breaking Changes
- If your application has compatibility issues after upgrading Node.js, review the breaking changes in the Node.js v20 release notes and address any deprecations or errors.

## <Icon icon="react"  size={30}/> Re-deploy Your Application
- Once the upgrade is complete and everything is working locally, deploy your updated Express.js application to your production environment.
- Monitor Logs: After deployment, monitor the application logs for any unexpected errors or warnings.

After following these steps, your Express.js project should be successfully upgraded to Node.js v20!
